Buffers and streams:

Buffers and streams are important concepts in Node.js for handling and manipulating data efficiently. They serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

Buffers:

Buffers are used to work with binary data in Node.js. They represent fixed-size chunks of memory that can store raw binary data.
Buffers are useful when you need to read, write, or manipulate binary data, such as working with images, files, or network protocols.
They provide a way to store and manipulate data in a compact and optimized format, making them efficient for tasks involving binary data.
Common use cases for buffers include reading or writing files, network communication, encryption, compression, and working with binary protocols.
Streams:

Streams in Node.js are used to process data piece by piece (or chunk by chunk) as it is being read from or written to a source or destination.
Streams enable efficient handling of large amounts of data without consuming excessive memory. Instead of loading the entire data into memory, streams process it incrementally.
Streams can be categorized into readable streams (for reading data) and writable streams (for writing data).
They are useful when dealing with real-time data processing, file I/O operations, network communication, and situations where data needs to be processed in a continuous and incremental manner.
Streams are memory-efficient and allow for pipelining, which means you can connect multiple streams together to create a data processing pipeline.
Here are some practical examples where buffers and streams are commonly used:

Reading a large file or streaming media: Instead of loading the entire file into memory, you can read it using a readable stream in chunks, process each chunk, and write it out using a writable stream. This approach allows efficient handling of large files or media streams without overwhelming memory resources.
Network communication: Buffers and streams are used for reading and writing data over network sockets, such as sending and receiving data over HTTP or TCP connections. Streams allow for efficient processing of incoming or outgoing data in small chunks.
Image manipulation: Buffers are useful for reading image data, manipulating pixel values, and writing the modified image data back to a file or sending it over a network.
Parsing and processing data: Streams are valuable for parsing and processing data in real-time, such as parsing and analyzing log files, processing data streams from external APIs, or transforming data formats.
In summary, buffers and streams provide powerful mechanisms for handling binary data and processing data incrementally. They are used in scenarios where memory efficiency, real-time data processing, or working with binary data is required, such as file I/O, network communication, and data manipulation tasks.
